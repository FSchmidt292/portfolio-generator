## How to run:
- THIS IS A NODE APP THAT RUNS FROM A MACHINES COMMAND LINE. Because of this fact, there is no deployed page in which to view the project. If you'd like to test this product out, please clone the code down to your personal computer. Once you've made sure you have all of the necessary NPM's and that Node is installed, you can run the app from the command line. cd into the directory, the run the app by entering the command "node app.js" into the command line.

-For purposes of testing the app, there is no need to enter in actual information. just enter in placeholder information, or if you'd like to see how the links fill in you can use actual github information.

## RESULTS:
-The resulting files will be saved to the dist folder after the app runs. It will copy a version of the style sheet, and it will create the HTML file inserting the user specific information into their pertinent fields.
